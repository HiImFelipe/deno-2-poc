# Deno 2 POC

Testing how my workflow works with Deno 2.
The idea was to build a DDD-ish application with a bunch of imports and also to make usage of the built-in testing library

The project makes usage of jsr which is their new npm superset

## Running

You must have deno 2.0 or higher

```
deno run src/main.ts
```

if you wish to run the tests only

```
deno test
```
